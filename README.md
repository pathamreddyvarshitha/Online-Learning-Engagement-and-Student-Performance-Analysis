Online Learning Engagement and Student Performance Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard, backed by SQL-based analysis, that identifies the factors behind student engagement, academic performance, and dropout on an online learning platform.

🎯 Problem
Instructors and coordinators have no consolidated, real-time view of student engagement and performance — so at-risk students are only noticed after they've already disengaged or dropped out.

📊 The Data
online_education_dataset — ~32,593 student records: demographics, engagement (clicks), performance (scores), and outcomes (pass/dropout/final result)
🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL (MySQL) — exploratory data analysis (ameesha.sql)
Power BI Desktop — data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard & report
Power Query / DAX — data cleaning and 5 core measures
📈 Key Insights
Engagement is the strongest predictor of outcomes: 78.10 avg score / 11.9% dropout for High-engagement students vs. 66.05 avg score / 43.6% dropout for Low-engagement students
31.16% overall dropout rate; 47.20% pass rate across 28,785 unique students
Dropout risk concentrates in specific regions (North Western, West Midlands) and in students with no formal prior qualifications
